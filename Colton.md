# Changes

1. Roof Pitch options need to be hardcoded

2. Door right edge position needs to go away. Left edge position needs to say "Feet from left corner wall"

3. Overhead doors need to have drop down lists for height and width.

4. Personnel Door Needs 'Endwall 3' Added to walls dropdown

5. "Expandable Endwall" Not Expendable. See the main Type, and the form.

6. "Height Lift" For overhead doors should be High Lift.

# Concerns

1. Windows.Width: Number, where the input is a string on the form.

2. Wall Alteration Group as a wall panel - Extension.

3. As of now the Misc. Framed. Openings. results in exhause fan and weather hood pricing only. No sq ft pricing is applied. Should be okay.
