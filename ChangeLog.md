1. On the steel selection sheet where you can choose endwall rafter material, I would like another selection where you can decide between the roof purlins being every 5’, or every 4’. We have it on 5’ now.

2. When we get to the lack of engineering disclaimer, not only does it need to discuss the need for the engineering on the structural members but it needs to discuss the need for engineering on the width and gauge of the purlins.

3. My guys are complaining that the gutter material is too short. Correction: if there are 4 or less pieces of gutter make them all 21’ long. If there are more than 4 pieces of gutter, change 4 of them that are output as 20’ 4” to 21’ long. 21’ is not a stock length but the companies do make them this length for this reason.

4. When we get to blueprints, we are going to need to come up with drawings of standard details for certain selections. I.e. if you select wainscoting you will have a drawing detail of what the wainscoting steel and sheetmetal will be like. If you select overhangs on the eave, you will have a drawing detail to show what that looks like. Etc.
